Benchmarking scripts
====================

These set of scripts perform different benchmarking operations
that can be useful to diagnose system performance
on different platforms.

Most of these were previously shipped
together with the `NGAS <https://github.com/ICRAR/ngas>`_ source code.
However, to make it easier to use them,
and since they follow a different lifecycle,
they have been placed into this new home.
